<p><strong>Air Quality Skill Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>Your privacy is valued, so I want to be explicit about what kind of&nbsp;personal information is involved when you interact with Air Quality.</p>
<p>Air Quality skill allows you&nbsp;to add 'places' where air quality observations and forecasts will be created for. A place consists of place name and address (see this&nbsp;<a href="https://alexapublic.s3.amazonaws.com/air-quality.html">guide</a>). You can also decide at what accuracy the address is given. All places will be persisted together with Alexa user ID so that places can later be found by the skill by using the user ID as a key. Only Air Quality skill can access this data provided that the request contains a valid user ID. Persisted places are&nbsp;not used for any other purpose. No other data is persisted by the skill.&nbsp;</p>
