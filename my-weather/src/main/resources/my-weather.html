<h1><em>My Weather</em></h1>
<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>My Wether is an Alexa&nbsp;skill which is able to read weather observations and forecats for places in Finland. Observation and forecast data&nbsp;is based on the <a href="https://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/open-data">Finnish Meterological Institute (FMI) open data</a>, which is licenced based on <a href="http://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/open-data-licence">CC BY 4.0 by FMI</a>.</p>
<p>Weather observations are read from FMI's weather station or observatory closest to the place given by the user. FMI has over 400 stations so the coverage is good all over Finland. The weather forecast is based on RCR HIRLAM numerical forecast.</p>
<p>User can add his/her different addresses, i.e. 'places', which will be persisted and used by the skill when the user asks observations or forecasts for the given place.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<h3>Places</h3>
<p>User can add address for the following place names:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>home, work, school, gym, cabin, downtown, place1, place2 and place3</em></p>
<p>Places are added to Alexa's to-do list by using the following syntax:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>place:&lt;place_name&gt;:&lt;street_address&gt;,&lt;city&gt;</em></p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">place:school:Nissintie 2,Espoo</p>
<p>User then asks Alexa to save places:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Alexa, ask My Weather to save places.</em></p>
<p>Notice that prior to using My Weather skill, the user must grant list read and write permissions to the skill in the ALexa application. After places were persisted then corresponding to-do list items will be automatically removed by the skill. Adding a new place with the same name will overwrite the old place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the user has not saved any places, then My Weather skill will get observations and forecasts for the capital city Helsinki.</p>
<h2>Example Utterances</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>Alexa, open my weather.</em>
<ul>
<li>This launches the interactive mode. Exit with <em>exit</em>, <em>stop</em>, <em>good bye</em>&nbsp;etc.</li>
<li>...get observations</li>
<li>...get forecast</li>
<li>etc. similar to one-shot commands listed below, but without <em>Alexa, ask My Weather to...</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Alexa, ask My Weather to get observations [for &lt;place_name&gt;]</em>
<ul>
<li>Speaks the latest weather observations for the given place. If place is not specified then observations will be for&nbsp;<em>home</em>, provided that it has been saved (if not then Helsinki will be used).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Alexa, ask My Weather to get forecast&nbsp;[for &lt;place_name&gt; [at [tomorrow] &lt;morning|noon|afternoon|evening|night&gt;]]</em><br />
